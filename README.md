- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigBadHoneyBadger (because I like using silly internet handles :D ), but my real name is Jacob Harrison.

- 👀 I’m interested in web apps, cyber security, blockchain/decentralized finance, and ML/AI applications!

- 🌱 I'm launching my software development career using pure determination, intelligence, and free online resources!
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you need an extra hand on! Any work is good work. ESPECIALLY for topics among my above listed interests!
     I'm the type of person to completely reorganize my life around my projects and interests - my best skill is to be ruthlessly dedicated.

- 📫 Reach me at LinkedIn ... www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-harrison-0
      I'm a hard worker, and I am looking to build a career. If you need a hand, I need the experience. Let's link up.
