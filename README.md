- 👋 Hi, I’m @BigBadHoneyBadger (because I like using silly internet handles :D ), but my real name is Jacob Harrison.

- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security, blockchain, decentralized finance, and ML/AI applications!

- 🌱 I'm launching my software development career using pure determination... and FreeCodeCamp!
     In search of professional experience; I'm trying to go full time into any role - I crave technical projects.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you need an extra hand on! Any work is good work. ESPECIALLY for topics among my above listed interests!
     I'm the type of person to completely reorganize my life around my projects and interests - my best skill is to be ruthlessly dedicated.

- 📫 Reach me at LinkedIn ... www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-harrison-0
      DON'T BE A STRANGER! I'm a people-person, and I would love to have a chat (short or long)!
